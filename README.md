Services Pages

Each service page outlines the core offerings of HnS Developers. Here's a brief description of the services covered:

    Financial Services: We offer invoicing, financial services application development, data verification & validation, and digital payment solutions.

    Web Development: Custom websites using the latest technologies and best practices for various business sizes.

    Advertisement: We cover social media marketing, banners, posters, flyers, hoardings, and promotional videos.

    Graphic Designing: Custom graphic design solutions including logo designing, social media advertisement design, and visiting card design.

Popup Functionality

We use a dynamic popup feature to show the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions:
Buttons in index.html:

html

<button id="privacyBtn">View Privacy Policy</button>
<button id="termsBtn">View Terms and Conditions</button>

JavaScript (script.js):

The file script.js handles loading the HTML files into the popup.

javascript

// Function to open popup with given content
function openPopup(title, file) {
    // Fetch and load the content dynamically
}

This allows users to view legal documents without leaving the page, providing a smoother user experience.
Privacy Policy & Terms and Conditions

Both the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions documents are included as standalone pages and can be viewed in the popup window. These pages detail how HnS Developers handles user data, security, and terms of service.
Contact Form

A Contact Us form is available on the more-services.html page where users can submit custom service requests. The form is designed with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern look:

html

<form class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
    <div>
        <label for="name">Your Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" class="border-gray-300 rounded mt-1 block w-full">
    </div>
    <div>
        <label for="email">Email Address</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" class="border-gray-300 rounded mt-1 block w-full">
    </div>
    <!-- More fields -->
</form>
